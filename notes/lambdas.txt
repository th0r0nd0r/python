lambdas

- similar to anonymous arrow functions in JavaScript, but can't be multiline

- can be assigned to a variable, or not

- can take multiple arguments

- can be used like closures, like in this example:


Say we want to build a function that builds other functions.  In this case, we want to build quadratics.

We can use lambdas to accomplish this.
