lambdas

- similar to anonymous arrow functions in JavaScript, but can't be multiline

- can be assigned to a variable, or not

- can take multiple arguments

- can be used like closures, like in this example:



Say we want to build a function that builds other functions.  In this case, we want to build quadratics.

We can use lambdas to accomplish this.

def build_quadratic_function(a,b,c):
  """returns the function f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c"""
  return lambda x: a*x**2 + b*x + c

some sample outputs:

f = build_quadratic_function(2, 3, -5):

>>>f(0)
-5
>>>f(1)
0
>>>f(2)
9

you can also pass values to the inner lambda all at once
(just like in JavaScript!)

## 3x^2 + 0x + 2 evaluated for 2
>>> build_quadratic_function(3, 0, 2)(2)
14
