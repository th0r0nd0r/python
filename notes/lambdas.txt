lambdas

- similar to anonymous arrow functions in JavaScript, but can't be multiline

- can be assigned to a variable, or not

- can take multiple arguments

- can be used like closures, like in this example:



Say we want to build a function that builds other functions.  In this case, we want to build quadratics.

We can use lambdas to accomplish this.

def build_quadratic_function(a,b,c):
  """returns the function f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c"""
  return lambda x: a*x**2 + b*x + c
