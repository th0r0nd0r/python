sys.argv


sys.argv is a list in Python, which contains the command-line arguments passed to the script.

With the len(sys.argv) function you can count the number of arguments.

If you are gonna work with command line arguments, you probably want to
use sys.argv.

To use sys.argv, you will first have to import the sys module.
Example
To show how this works.

(Remember that sys.argv[0] is the name of the script.
import sys
print "This is the name of the script: ", sys.argv[0]
print "Number of arguments: ", len(sys.argv)
print "The arguments are: " , str(sys.argv)
Output
This is the name of the script:  sysargv.py
Number of arguments in:  1
The arguments are:  ['sysargv.py']

If I run it again with additional arguments, I will get this output:

This is the name of the script:  sysargv.py
Number of arguments in:  3
The arguments are:  ['sysargv.py', 'arg1', 'arg2']
