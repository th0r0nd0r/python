Mostly the same but here are some differences.

- the class is called str not String, so don't assign variables to str (it will overwrite the native str)

- the escape character is \ not /

- strings can span multiple lines, but there must be a \ to escape the newline
- triple quotes (""" or ''') don't need to escape newlines

- it's len(string) not string.length
