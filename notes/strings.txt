Mostly the same but here are some differences.



Class:
- the class is called str not String, so don't assign variables to str (it will overwrite the native str)



Escaping:
- the escape character is \ not /
- strings can span multiple lines, but there must be a \ to escape the newline
- triple quotes (""" or ''') don't need to escape newlines



Methods:
- it's len(string) not string.length
- don't use len as a variable name to avoid blocking out len() function
- it's str(var) not var.to_s

- in general, it seems that a lot of methods that would be .method in ruby, are method() in python



Operations:
