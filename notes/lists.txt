Python has a data type called "list," which I'm pretty sure is gonna be a dynamic array.



Assignment to Variables:
  - assigning a variable to a list doesn't make a copy
  - it makes that variable point to the list in memory


Concatenation:
  - use + to smash 2 mf lists together
  - this creates a new list (editing the new list won't affect the original lists)



For loops:
  - Unlike JavaScript, you don't need to keep track of an index variable (i)
  - Unlike Ruby, you don't have each or blocks
